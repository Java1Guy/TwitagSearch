/search is setup as a cron task that runs every 2 minutes.
It's mapped to the twitagsearch.SearchPage RequestHandler, which calls twitagsearch.Search().
Which calls api.Search (added by me to twitter.py).
I also just added code to set the User-Agent,
which apparently ups your search limit (otherwise app engine IPs get rate limited
 fairly often), haven't deployed to see if that helps.

So, to use this code yourself:

- put valid strings in USERNAME, PASSWORD, USER_AGENT in twitagsearch.py (create a new twitter account).
- tweak twitagsearch.Search() to be what you want to search for
    (http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-Search-API-Method:-search)
- Create a new model.py that has objects for what you want to store.
- Create new pages for retrieving the data.
